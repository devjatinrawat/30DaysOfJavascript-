- First Phase Is Called Memory Creation Phase , it just scans and searches 
var let and const and make Memory and give that name ex firstName
- it will keep undefined , typeofundefined is undefined
- means memory creation is taking place via javascript engine.
- it is reserving the memory
- it will skip console.log phase
 - Second Phase is Code Execution Phase , here all the code comes into play
 - now all the variables get the values 
 -  all the undefined values are replaced . also the type will change.
 - All Actual Values Get Placed.
 - sources tag there is a debugger for you.
 -  One Extra Thing with let is that is released in 2015 it comes in extra validation until you didnt give any value 
 what the use is of it.
