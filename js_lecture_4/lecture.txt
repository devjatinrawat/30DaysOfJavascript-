

- when we dont intiate any value , js put undefined into it.
- experiment with it
- let a =null
- variable can be reassigned
- using constant we cant reassigned  the value of that variable .
- 'const' declarations must be initialized. we`ll used more const only  very less. very less well use let. when we know that let var value would change.
- let & Const is blocked Scoped . so if the value is declared not used that error is shwon.
-not defined will be shown if var is not created
 - First imp difference : 43:06 - Difference Between let and var in JavaScript - First
 - 47:34 - Difference Between let and var in JavaScript - Second
